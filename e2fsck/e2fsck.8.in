.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @FSCKPROG@
is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file systems.   
For ext3 and ext4 filesystems that use a journal, if the system has been
shut down uncleanly without any errors, normally, after replaying the
committed transactions  in the journal, the file system should be
marked as clean.   Hence, for filesystems that use journalling,
.B @FSCKPROG@
will normally replay the journal and exit, unless its superblock
indicates that further checking is required.
.PP
.I device
is the device file where the filesystem is stored (e.g.
.IR /dev/hdc1 ).
.PP
Note that in general it is not safe to run
.B @FSCKPROG@
on mounted filesystems.  The only exception is if the
.B \-n
option is specified, and 
.BR \-c , 
.BR \-l ,
or
.B -L
options are 
.I not
specified.   However, even if it is safe to do so, the results printed by
.B @FSCKPROG@
are not valid if the filesystem is mounted.   If 
.B @FSCKPROG@
asks whether or not you should check a filesystem which is mounted, 
the only correct answer is ``no''.  Only experts who really know what
they are doing should consider answering this question in any other way.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-a 
This option does the same thing as the 
.B \-p
option.  It is provided for backwards compatibility only; it is
suggested that people use 
.B \-p 
option whenever possible.
.TP
.BI \-b " superblock"
Instead of using the normal superblock, use an alternative superblock
specified by 
.IR superblock .
This option is normally used when the primary superblock has been
corrupted.  The location of the backup superblock is dependent on the
filesystem's blocksize.  For filesystems with 1k blocksizes, a backup
superblock can be found at block 8193; for filesystems with 2k
blocksizes, at block 16384; and for 4k blocksizes, at block 32768.  
.IP
Additional backup superblocks can be determined by using the 
.B @MKFSPROG@
program using the 
.B \-n
option to print out where the superblocks were created.   The 
.B \-b 
option to 
.BR @MKFSPROG@ ,
which specifies blocksize of the filesystem must be specified in order
for the superblock locations that are printed out to be accurate.
.IP
If an alternative superblock is specified and  
the filesystem is not opened read-only, @FSCKPROG@ will make sure that the
primary superblock is updated appropriately upon completion of the 
filesystem check.
.TP
.BI \-B " blocksize"
Normally, 
.B @FSCKPROG@
will search for the superblock at various different
block sizes in an attempt to find the appropriate block size.
This search can be fooled in some cases.  This option forces 
.B @FSCKPROG@
to only try locating the superblock at a particular blocksize.
If the superblock is not found, 
.B @FSCKPROG@
will terminate with a fatal error.
.TP
.B \-c
This option causes 
.B @FSCKPROG@
to use 
.BR badblocks (8)
program to do a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad
blocks.  If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block
inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or directory.  If
this option is specified twice, then the bad block scan will be done
using a non-destructive read-write test.
.TP
.BI \-C " fd"
This option causes
.B @FSCKPROG@
to write completion information to the specified file descriptor 
so that the progress of the filesystem 
check can be monitored.  This option is typically used by programs 
which are running
.BR @FSCKPROG@ .
If the file descriptor number is negative, then absolute value of
the file descriptor will be used, and the progress information will be
suppressed initially.  It can later be enabled by sending the
.B @FSCKPROG@
process a SIGUSR1 signal.
If the file descriptor specified is 0, 
.B @FSCKPROG@
will print a completion bar as it goes about its business.  This requires
that @FSCKPROG@ is running on a video console or terminal.
.TP
.B \-d
Print debugging output (useless unless you are debugging
.BR @FSCKPROG@ ).
.TP
.B \-D
Optimize directories in filesystem.  This option causes @FSCKPROG@ to
try to optimize all directories, either by reindexing them if the
filesystem supports directory indexing,  or by sorting and compressing
directories for smaller directories, or for filesystems using
traditional linear directories.
.IP
Even without the
.B \-D
option,
.B @FSCKPROG@
may sometimes optimize a few directories --- for example, if
directory indexing is enabled and a directory is not indexed and would
benefit from being indexed, or if the index structures are corrupted
and need to be rebuilt.  The
.B \-D
option forces all directories in the filesystem to be optimized.  This can
sometimes make them a little smaller and slightly faster to search, but
in practice, you should rarely need to use this option.
.IP
The
.B \-D
option will detect directory entries with duplicate names in a single
directory, which @FSCKPROG@ normally does not enforce for performance reasons.
.TP
.BI \-E " extended_options"
Set @FSCKPROG@ extended options.  Extended options are comma
separated, and may take an argument using the equals ('=') sign.  The 
following options are supported:
.RS 1.2i
.TP
.BI clone= dup|zero
Resolve files with shared blocks in pass 1D by giving each file a private
copy of the blocks (dup);
or replacing the shared blocks with private, zero-filled blocks (zero).  
The default is dup.
.TP
.BI shared= preserve|lost+found|delete
Files with shared blocks discovered in pass 1D are cloned and then left 
in place (preserve); 
cloned and then disconnected from their parent directory,
then reconnected to /lost+found in pass 3 (lost+found); 
or simply deleted (delete).  The default is preserve.
.TP
.BI ea_ver= extended_attribute_version
Set the version of the extended attribute blocks which
.B @FSCKPROG@
will require while checking the filesystem.  The version number may 
be 1 or 2.  The default extended attribute version format is 2.
.TP
.BI journal_only
Only replay the journal if required, but do not perform any further checks
or repairs.
.TP
.BI inode_badness_threshold= threshold_value
A badness counter is associated with every inode, which determines the degree
of inode corruption. Each error found in the inode will increase the badness by
1 or 2, and inodes with a badness at or above
.I threshold_value
will be prompted for deletion. The default
.I threshold_value
is 7.
.TP
.BI fragcheck
During pass 1, print a detailed report of any discontiguous blocks for
files in the filesystem.
.RE
.TP
.B \-f
Force checking even if the file system seems clean.
.TP
.B \-F
Flush the filesystem device's buffer caches before beginning.  Only
really useful for doing 
.B @FSCKPROG@
time trials.
@JDEV@.TP
@JDEV@.BI \-j " external-journal"
@JDEV@Set the pathname where the external-journal for this filesystem can be
@JDEV@found.
.TP
.BI \-k
When combined with the 
.B \-c
option, any existing bad blocks in the bad blocks list are preserved,
and any new bad blocks found by running
.BR badblocks (8) 
will be added to the existing bad blocks list.
.TP
.BI \-l " filename"
Add the block numbers listed in the file specified by 
.I filename
to the list of bad blocks.  The format of this file is the same as the
one generated by the 
.BR badblocks (8)
program.  Note that the block numbers are based on the blocksize
of the filesystem.  Hence, 
.BR badblocks (8)
must be given the blocksize of the filesystem in order to obtain correct
results.  As a result, it is much simpler and safer to use the 
.B -c
option to 
.BR @FSCKPROG@ ,
since it will assure that the correct parameters are passed to the
.B badblocks
program.
.TP
.BI \-L " filename"
Set the bad blocks list to be the list of blocks specified by 
.IR filename .
(This option is the same as the 
.B \-l
option, except the bad blocks list is cleared before the blocks listed
in the file are added to the bad blocks list.)
.TP
.B \-n
Open the filesystem read-only, and assume an answer of `no' to all
questions.  Allows
.B @FSCKPROG@
to be used non-interactively.  This option
may not be specified at the same time as the 
.B \-p
or
.B \-y
options.
.TP
.B \-p
Automatically repair ("preen") the file system.  This option will cause
.B @FSCKPROG@
to automatically
fix any filesystem problems that can be safely fixed without human
intervention.  If 
.B @FSCKPROG@
discovers a problem which may require the system administrator
to take additional corrective action, 
.B @FSCKPROG@
will print a description of the problem and then exit with the value 4
logically or'ed into the exit code.  (See the \fBEXIT CODE\fR section.)
This option is normally used by the system's boot scripts.  It may not 
be specified at the same time as the
.B \-n
or
.B \-y
options.
.TP
.B \-r
This option does nothing at all; it is provided only for backwards
compatibility.
.TP
.B \-t
Print timing statistics for
.BR @FSCKPROG@ .
If this option is used twice, additional timing statistics are printed
on a pass by pass basis.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-y
Assume an answer of `yes' to all questions; allows 
.B @FSCKPROG@
to be used non-interactively.  This option
may not be specified at the same time as the 
.B \-n
or
.B \-p
options.
@LFSCK_MAN@.TP
@LFSCK_MAN@.BI \-\-mdsdb " mds_database_filename"
@LFSCK_MAN@Specify which file to use for an MDS database on a Lustre filesystem.
@LFSCK_MAN@The mdsdb also needs to be specified when creating an OST database with
@LFSCK_MAN@.B \-\-ostdb
@LFSCK_MAN@but the mdsdb file used in a read-only manner.
@LFSCK_MAN@.TP
@LFSCK_MAN@.BI \-\-ostdb " ostN_database_filename"
@LFSCK_MAN@Specify which file to use for an OST database on a Lustre filesystem.
@LFSCK_MAN@A separate database file should be specified for each OST device in
@LFSCK_MAN@the filesystem.  For convenience a stub
@LFSCK_MAN@.BR mdsdb .hdr
@LFSCK_MAN@file is generated for use by the OST @FSCKPROG@ to avoid the need to
@LFSCK_MAN@wait for the MDS @FSCKPROG@ to finish or copy the full mdsdb to the OSTs.
.SH EXIT CODE
The exit code returned by
.B @FSCKPROG@
is the sum of the following conditions:
.br
\	0\	\-\ No errors
.br
\	1\	\-\ File system errors corrected
.br
\	2\	\-\ File system errors corrected, system should
.br
\	\	\ \ be rebooted
.br
\	4\	\-\ File system errors left uncorrected
.br
\	8\	\-\ Operational error
.br
\	16\	\-\ Usage or syntax error
.br
\	32\	\-\ @FSCKPROG@ canceled by user request
.br
\	128\	\-\ Shared library error
.br
.SH SIGNALS
The following signals have the following effect when sent to 
.BR @FSCKPROG@ .
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
This signal causes
.B @FSCKPROG@
to start displaying a completion bar or emitting progress information.  
(See discussion of the 
.B \-C
option.)
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
This signal causes
.B @FSCKPROG@
to stop displaying a completion bar or emitting progress information.
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Almost any piece of software will have bugs.  If you manage to find a
filesystem which causes 
.B @FSCKPROG@
to crash, or which 
.B @FSCKPROG@
is unable to repair, please report it to the author.
.PP
Please include as much information as possible in your bug report.
Ideally, include a complete transcript of the
.B @FSCKPROG@
run, so I can see exactly what error messages are displayed.  (Make sure
the messages printed by 
.B @FSCKPROG@
are in English; if your system has been
configured so that 
.BR @FSCKPROG@ 's
messages have been translated into another language, please set the the
.B LC_ALL
environment variable to
.B C
so that the transcript of @FSCKPROG@'s output will be useful to me.)
If you
have a writable filesystem where the transcript can be stored, the 
.BR script (1)
program is a handy way to save the output of
.B @FSCKPROG@
to a file.
.PP
It is also useful to send the output of 
.BR @DUMPFSPROG@ (8).
If a specific inode or inodes seems to be giving 
.B @FSCKPROG@
trouble, try running the
.BR @DEBUGFSPROG@ (8)
command and send the output of the 
.BR stat (1u)
command run on the relevant inode(s).  If the inode is a directory, the 
.B @DEBUGFSPROG@
.I dump
command will allow you to extract the contents of the directory inode,
which can sent to me after being first run through
.BR uuencode (1).  
The most useful data you can send to help reproduce
the bug is a compressed raw image dump of the filesystem, generated using
.BR @IMAGEPROG@ (8).
See the 
.BR @IMAGEPROG@ (8)
man page for more details.
.PP
Always include the full version string which 
.B @FSCKPROG@
displays when it is run, so I know which version you are running.

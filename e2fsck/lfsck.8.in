.SH NAME
lfsck \- check a Lustre distributed filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lfsck
[
.B \-cdfhlnv
]
.B \--mdsdb
.I mds_database_file
.B \--ostdb
.IR "ost1_database_file " [ "ost2_database_file " ...]
.I filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lfsck
is used to check and repair the distributed coherency of a Lustre filesystem.
.PP
.I filesystem
is the mountpoint of the Lustre filesystem to be checked. e.g.
.IR /mnt/lustre ).
.SH DESCRIPTION
Lfsck is used to do the distributed coherency checking of a Lustre filesystem
after
.B e2fsck
has been run on each of the local MDS and OST device filesystems.
.B Lfsck
will ensure that objects are not referenced by multiple MDS files, that there
are no orphan objects on the OSTs (objects that do not have any file on the
MDS which references them), and that all of the objects referenced by the
MDS exist.  Under normal circumstances Lustre will maintain such coherency
by distributed logging mechanisms, but under exceptional circumstances that
may fail (e.g. disk failure, filesystem corruption leading to e2fsck repair).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Create (empty) missing OST objects referenced by MDS inodes.
.TP
.B \-d
Delete orphaned objects from the filesystem.  Since objects on the OST are
often only one of several stripes of a file it can be difficult to put
multiple objects back together into a single usable file.
.TP
.B \-h
Print a brief help message.
.TP
.B \-l
Put orphaned objects into a lost+found directory in the root of the filesystem.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not repair the filesystem, just perform a read-only check (default).
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose operation - more verbosity by specifing option multiple times.
.TP
.BI \-\-mdsdb " mds_database_file"
The MDS database file created by running
.B e2fsck --mdsdb mds_database_file device
on the MDS backing device.  This is required.
.TP
.BI \-\-ostdb " ost1_database_file " [ "ost2_database_file " ...]
The OST database files created by running
.B e2fsck --ostdb ost_database_file device
on each of the OST backing devices.  These are required, unless an OST is
unavailable, in which case all objects thereon will be considered missing.

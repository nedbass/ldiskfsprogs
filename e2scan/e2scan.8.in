.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR e2scan ,
iterates all inodes on
.IR device ,
find inodes modified since the specified time (default 1 day), and prints
their pathnames relative to the root of the filesystem.  This allows the
pathnames to be used as input to a backup tool running in the mountpoint, like
.BR "tar \-C" ,
as the filesystem may be mounted at an arbitrary mountpoint.

The
.B e2scan
program is optimized for scanning an entire filesystem for (modified) files,
but is not efficient for smaller subdirectory scans.  Use
.BR find (1)
for that purpose instead.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-a " groups"
Set readahead for inode table blocks to get better performance when scanning
.IR device .
Default is 1 group of readahead.
.TP
.BI \-b " inode_buffer_blocks"
Set number of inode blocks to read from disk at a time.
.TP
.BI \-C " directory"
Specify the working directory (relative to the root of the filesystem
being scanned) for the output pathnames.  Only directories underneath
the root will be candidates for listing.  For Lustre MDT filesystems the
pathname must be prefixed with "/ROOT" to dump the client visible filesystem.
@E2SCAN_MAN@.TP
@E2SCAN_MAN@.BI \-d " database_file"
@E2SCAN_MAN@Specify output file for database when running in
@E2SCAN_MAN@.B \-f
@E2SCAN_MAN@mode.
.TP
.B \-D
Also include directories in the output.  The default is to only list files,
because tools like
.BR tar (1)
will recurse into directories and files that are also listed therein will be
backed up twice.
@E2SCAN_MAN@.TP
@E2SCAN_MAN@.B \-f
@E2SCAN_MAN@List files in the filesystem and insert them into the
@E2SCAN_MAN@.BR sqlite3 (1)
@E2SCAN_MAN@database named by the
@E2SCAN_MAN@.B \-d
@E2SCAN_MAN@option.
.TP
.B \-l
List files in the filesystem to standard output, or to the file specified
with the
.B \-o
option.  This is the default mode.
.TP
.BI \-n " filename"
Dump only files newer than the specified
.IR filename .
.TP
.BI \-N " date"
Dump only files newer than the specified date.  This supports a wide
variety of input formats like "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".  Use a date of
.R 0
to dump all files.
.TP
.BI \-o " outfile"
Record the files found into
.I outfile
instead of the default standard output.
.SH EXAMPLES
To dump all of the files in the filesystem into the file
.IR myfilelist :
.IP
e2scan -N 0 -o myfilelist /dev/sdb1
.PP
To list files and directories newer than Feb 6, 2007 in the /home directory:
.IP
e2scan -D -N "Feb 6 00:00:00 2007" -C /home /dev/sdb1
.PP

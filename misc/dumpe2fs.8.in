.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @DUMPFSPROG@
prints the super block and blocks group information for the filesystem
present on
.I device.
.PP
.B @DUMPFSPROG@
is similar to Berkeley's
.B dumpfs
program for the BSD Fast File System.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b
print the blocks which are reserved as bad in the filesystem.
.TP
.B \-o superblock=\fIsuperblock
use the block
.I superblock
when examining the filesystem.
This option is not usually needed except by a filesystem wizard who 
is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted filesystem.
.TP
.B \-o blocksize=\fIblocksize
use blocks of
.I blocksize
bytes when examining the filesystem.
This option is not usually needed except by a filesystem wizard who 
is examining the remains of a very badly corrupted filesystem.
.TP
.B \-f
force @DUMPFSPROG@ to display a filesystem even though it may have some
filesystem feature flags which @DUMPFSPROG@ may not understand (and which
can cause some of @DUMPFSPROG@'s display to be suspect).
.TP 
.B \-h
only display the superblock information and not any of the block
group descriptor detail information.
.TP
.B \-i
display the filesystem data from an image file created by 
.BR e2image ,
using 
.I device
as the pathname to the image file.
.TP
.B \-x
print the detailed group information block numbers in hexadecimal format
.TP
.B \-V
print the version number of 
.B @DUMPFSPROG@
and exit.
.SH BUGS
You need to know the physical filesystem structure to understand the
output.

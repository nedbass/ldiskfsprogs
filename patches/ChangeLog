Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 22162
Description: Support journals larger than 2GB
Details    : libext2fs wasn't handling the high bits of the journal inode size

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 23502
Description: Fix slowdown when creating large extent-mapped journals (> 1GB)
Details    : When ext2fs_block_iterate2() is called on an extent-mapped file
	     with a depth > 1, it will erroneously calling the callback
	     function starting all over again with logical block 0.  It
	     shouldn't do this, and it cases mke2fs to become very slow when
	     creating files with very large extent-mapped journals.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 21683
Description: Add --lazy-journal-init option to speed up mke2fs.
Details    : This allows creating large journal files quickly during testing,
	     but is not strictly safe for production, since it is possible
	     in theory to have the journal accidentally replay the wrong data,
	     IFF the journal is not overwritten before the first crash.

Bugzilla   : 18779
Description: Fix a corruption problem in upstream e2fsprogs-1.41.10 when
	     "e2fsck -D" is run on a non-indexed directory with a directory
	     entry that sorts before "." or "..".  This was never in any

Severity   : enhancement
Description: update to latest upstream e2fsprogs release
Details    : Update to upstream e2fsprogs release 1.41.5.  This moves a

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 18735
Description: add "clear-mmp" option to tune2fs to reset the MMP e2fsck marker
Details    : add an option to run "tune2fs -f -E clear-mmp" to reset the MMP
	     block, which is easier than disabling and re-enabling it.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10555
Description: Add FIEMAP(FIle Extent MAP) ioctl support to filefrag
Details    : FIEMAP ioctl allows applications to efficiently fetch the extent
	     information of a file. It can be used to map logical blocks in a

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 15872
Description: tune2fs cannot disable uninit_groups or mmp features
Details    : Upstream changes to the structure of tune2fs broke the
	     ability to disable the uninit_groups and mmp features.
	     This is particularly serious for mmp, because it will
	     render the filesystem unmountable.

Bugzilla   : 15725
Description: fsck (e2fsck) -m hangs headless node
Details    : -m support for SLES10 patch was removed as this feature was 
	     included in upstream e2fsprogs. But upstream e2fsprogs uses 
	     "-M" whereas SLES10 assumes it to be "-m". Added this patch
	     to provide compatibility with SLES10.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 15320
Description: OSS crashes as e2fsck doesn't fix the header
Details    : When the last extent index contained in an inode is deleted
	     it resulsts in a condition, eh_entries = 0 and eh_depth !=0, 
	     which ldiskfs doesn't expect this and crashes. Fixed it by

	     into a separate libcom_err RPM.  On RHEL5 the libraries are
	     split into a separate e2fsprogs-libs RPM.  Add an "Obsoletes"

Details    : On SLES10 the e2fsprogs package has patches to add new functions

Severity   : major

Bugzilla   : 14085
Description: e2fsck aborts if a non-regular file has a corrupt EA block
Details    : e2fsck incorrectly set an error return code if it read a
	     corrupt EA block and in the case of a file that did not have
	     any data blocks the error was not reset, causing e2fsck to
	     exit with an error.  The EA block read should not be returning

Bugzilla   : 13812
Description: e2fsck can corrupt files by changing the i_size
Details    : On systems where page size is greater than filesystem blocksize

	     Fix the check to allow blocks to the end of PAGE_SIZE.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 13108
Description: Add e2scan program to efficiently scan filesystems for changes.
Details    : The e2scan program scans a filesystem for files that have changed
	     since a specific time.  This is usually more efficient than
	     doing a filesystem-level scan as it avoids seeking as much as
	     possible.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11644
Description: Improve e2fsck heuristics for detecting corrupted inodes
Details    : Instead of doing piecemeal checking of inodes, this tracks all
	     errors detected in each inode, and if a certain badness threshold
	     is exceeded, the inode should be considered garbage.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rarely, only for failover machines
Bugzilla   : 6334
Description: Multiple mount protection support
Details    : The INCOMPAT_MMP feature will protect the filesystem from being
	     mounted more than once simultaneously, even on different nodes.
	     It will also protect against changes by e2fsprogs to the
	     filesystem if it is mounted. This assumes high importance in a
	     shared storage environment where multiple mounts can severely
	     corrupt the filesystem.

Severity   : normal

Bugzilla   : 13111
Description: Disable resize2fs if extents are enabled
Details    : We have received reports of resize2fs corrupting the filesystem

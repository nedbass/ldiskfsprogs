README for e2fsprogs/patches

This directory contains patches from Sun Microsystems, Inc. that are
ALREADY applied to this version of e2fsprogs, in the order specified
by "series".  Some of the patches here are "historical" in the sense
that they have already been added to the upstream e2fsprogs repository
since this release, but they are not in any official e2fsprogs release
so are included here for reference.

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to have an SRPM that doesn't have the
patches applied, because the patches change the "configure" script, and
that in turn changes the .spec file (built from .spec.in) and that is
sourced by rpmbuild before the patches are applied...
